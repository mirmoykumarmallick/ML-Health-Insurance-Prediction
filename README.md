# Health Insurance Premium Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict health insurance premiums based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and geographic region. By utilizing different machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we can achieve accurate predictions and gain insights into the influencing factors of insurance costs.

## Project Overview

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization. The models are assessed using performance metrics like R-squared and RMSE to compare their effectiveness.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical variables using one-hot encoding and scales numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data relationships through heatmaps, distribution plots, and box plots.
- **Modeling**: Implements Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
- **Model Comparison**: Compares the performance of models based on R-squared and RMSE scores.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes model performance using hyperparameter tuning.
- **Visualizations**: Colorful and intuitive visualizations for data and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- XGBoost
- Google Colab

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a health insurance dataset that contains the following features:
- `age`: Age of the insured.
- `sex`: Gender of the insured.
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index.
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance.
- `smoker`: Smoking status (yes/no).
- `region`: Geographic region of the insured.
- `charges`: The insurance premium.
